[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

This repository contains code for image processing using Google Earth Engine (GEE). It covers a range of image processing techniques, from basic to advanced, using the powerful capabilities of GEE.

## Overview

The aim of this project is to provide a comprehensive resource for image processing in the field of remote sensing and geographic information systems. GEE is a cloud-based platform that enables users to analyze and visualize large-scale geospatial data. By leveraging GEE's extensive library of Earth observation datasets and its powerful processing capabilities, users can perform a wide range of image processing tasks efficiently and effectively.

## Prerequisites

To use the code in this repository, you must have a Google Earth Engine account. GEE provides access to a vast collection of satellite imagery and geospatial datasets, and it offers a JavaScript-based programming interface for performing analyses. If you don't have a GEE account, you can sign up for free at [https://earthengine.google.com](https://earthengine.google.com).
